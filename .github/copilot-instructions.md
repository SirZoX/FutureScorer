# AI Agent Coding Instructions (Universal)

- All function and variable names must use camelCase (e.g., `myFunction`, `orderId`).
- Do not use underscores or hyphens in function or variable names.
- All code comments must be in English. If you find comments in another language, translate them to English.
- Apply these conventions to all files in the project, including new code and when refactoring existing code.
- If you find code that does not follow these rules, refactor it to comply.
- These rules take precedence over any project-specific or default conventions.
- All the iterations between us must be in spanish, but keep the code comments in English.
- After a modification, always execute the command `git add .` to stage all changes and then commit with a message that describes the changes made in spanish, and finally add command `git push` to upload the changes
- never ask me if I want to apply suggested changes, always apply them directly.
- when refactoring code, ensure that the logic remains unchanged and that the code is functionally equivalent to the original.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code, ask for clarification in Spanish.
- Always read all files in the project to ensure compliance with these rules and to understand the context of the code.
- Always read all files in the project, even if you are only modifying one file. This ensures that you understand the context and can apply the coding standards consistently.
- Always read files completely, even if they are large. This helps ensure that you do not miss any important context or details that could affect your modifications.
- Never delete code when refactoring or modifying files. If you find code that is not needed, comment it out instead of deleting it and notice me. This allows for easier debugging and understanding of the code's history.
- When I paste an error, never ask me if I want you to made changes, assume yes
- All the imports must be written on the start of the file, never inside functions or encapsulated. Then on the code call the var or function imported
- NEVER create .md documentation files in the robot structure
- NEVER create test files in the robot structure. Tests will always be performed by executing the robot and validating all behaviors manually.
- Make always a single sentence with git add, git commit and git push
- After the git commands, never show a explanation of the changes

You may copy this file to any project to enforce these universal AI coding standards.
